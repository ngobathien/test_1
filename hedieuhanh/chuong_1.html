        A modern computer consists of one or more processors, some main memory,
        disks, printers, a keyboard, a mouse, a display, network interfaces, and
        various other input/output devices. All in all, a complex system.oo If
        every application programmer had to understand how all these things work
        in detail, no code would ever get written. Furthermore, managing all
        these components and using them optimally is an exceedingly challenging
        job. For this reason, computers are equipped with a layer of software
        called the operating system, whose job is to provide user programs with
        a better, simpler, cleaner, model of the computer and to handle managing
        all the resources just mentioned. Operating systems are the subject of
        this book.

        Most readers will have had some experience with an operating system such
        as Windows, Linux, FreeBSD, or OS X, but appearances can be deceiving.
        The program that users interact with, usually called the shell when it
        is text based and the GUI (Graphical User Interface)—which is pronounced
        ‘‘gooey’’—when it uses icons, is actually not part of the operating
        system, although it uses the operating system to get its work done.

        A simple overview of the main components under discussion here is given
        in Fig. 1-1. Here we see the hardware at the bottom. The hardware
        consists of chips, boards, disks, a keyboard, a monitor, and similar
        physical objects. On top of the hardware is the software. Most computers
        have two modes of operation: kernel mode and user mode. The operating
        system, the most fundamental piece of software, runs in kernel mode
        (also called supervisor mode). In this mode it has complete access to
        all the hardware and can execute any instruction the machine is capable
        of executing. The rest of the software runs in user mode, in which only
        a subset of the machine instructions is available. In particular, those
        instructions that affect control of the machine or do I/O )Input/Output"
        are forbidden to user-mode programs. We will come back to the difference
        between kernel mode and user mode repeatedly throughout this book. It
        plays a crucial role in how operating systems work.
